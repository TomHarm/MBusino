# MBusino
[![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.7.0-brightgreen.svg)](CHANGELOG.md)<br/>
M-Bus/OneWire/I²C --> MQTT-Gateway with a shield for ESP8266 D1 mini

- M-Bus e.g. heatmeter (only one device at the moment)
- OneWire 5x e.g. DS18B20, temperature
- I²C e.g.. BME280, temperatur, r. humidity, air pressure

**NEW** MBusinoAP with Access Point setup Portal **NEW**

## Hardware
The PCB is designed with fritzing.
M-Bus is provided by a piggyback M-Bus master.
https://de.aliexpress.com/item/33008746192.html --> the Master! (the picture at ali shows a different board, but you will receive the right one)

Beside the USB power supply of D1 mini is no other adapter necessary.

The Board is usable for only M-Bus (see MBusino_naked code) or only sensor meassuring as well.  

Use 2,54mm terminals or JST XH to connect the DS18B20

You will find a 3D-printable PCB case inside the case folder.  

To save mony, I place omnibus orders for all parts.

## calibration capabilities 

Most DS18B20 are faked and out of specifications.
You can calibrate the sensors by sending a MQTT message to MBusino.
Subscribe at topic MBusino/cal/# for calibration replies. 

### 1. Set the average of all DS sensors
* MQTT Topic: MBusino/calibrateAverage
* MQTT Payload: no matter

Make the average of the connected sensors and add an offset to every sensor. After the calibration, all sensors will show the same value.
You have to bring all connected sensors to the same environment, wait a little bit and send the calibration message.

### 2. Calibrate to a connected Bosch BME280 Sensor
* MQTT Topic: MBusino/calibrateBME
* MQTT Payload: no matter

Make an offset for every DS sensor based at the meassured value of the BME sensor. After the calibration, all sensors will show the same value.
You have to bring all connected sensors to the same environment, wait a little bit and send the calibration message.

### 3. Calibration by hand
* MQTT Topic: MBusino/calibrateSensor
* MQTT Payload: Number of the Sensor to calibrate (only the number). e.g.S3 = 3
* MQTT Topic: MBusino/calibrateValue
* MQTT Payload: a float number e.g. -0.15

Manipulate the offset of a single sensor by sending sensor numbers and values. The transmitted value will be added to the current offset. First chose the sensor, then send the value. If a sensor is chosed, multiple manipulations of the same sensor are possible.


### 4. Set all offsets to zero
* MQTT Topic: MBusino/calibrateSet0
* MQTT Payload: no matter

Self explanatory.


## known issues
- Flashing over USB is only possible, if the M-Bus master is not connected. OTA update work fine.

- Do not use 2 Boards simultaneously without changing MBUSINO_NAME or it cause in network problems, both boards becomes unreachable. #define MBUSINO_NAME "MBusino"

- M-Bus is tested with a "Engelmann Sensostar U" and some other slaves, it should work with most M-Bus devices. If you have M-Bus issues, let me know.

## MBusinoAP

* MBusinoAP WiFi Setup Portal
* SSID "MBusino Setup Portal" (no Password) IP: 192.168.4.1
* If MbusinoAP do not find a known network, he start an AP for 5 minutes. After this period, he will restart and search again.
* In known networks, you will find the IP of the portal in your router.
